GramSetu AI is a voice-first platform that bridges the digital divide for rural India. Citizens call from any phone (no internet needed) and speak naturally in local languages. The AI checks government scheme eligibility, files grievances through UMANG/CPGRAMS, and completes transactions - providing true agency, not just information.
